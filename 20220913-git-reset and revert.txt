pull , fetch and merge

Git merge and git rebase:
--------------------------
Merge and Rebase both are going to be using to move changes from one branch to other branch

merge:
------
git merge master --no-ff			--> it will create some extra commit 

Rebase:
-------
git rebase master


Revert and Reset:
-----------------
git log --oneline			--> to get commits

You can also think of git revert as a tool for undoing committed changes, while git reset HEAD is for undoing uncommitted changes.

git revert <commit-id>
	--> It will create some extra commit 

git reset --hard <commit-id>
	Here we just move head position --> it will not create any extra commit, also it will delete existing commits


Local Repository	--> 
Staging area
Working area

git reset --soft		--> changes remains exist at staging area
git reset --mixed		--> changes remains exist at working area
git reset --hard		--> changes will not be exist anymore
